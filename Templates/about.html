    <h1>WELCOME TO BREAST CANCER PREDICTION SYSTEM</h1>
    
    <h4>
      Early detection saves lives. Get started by predicting breast cancer. Breast cancer is cancer that forms in the cells of the breast.
      After skin cancer, breast cancer is the most common cancer diagnosed in women in the United States. Breast cancer can occur in both men and 
      women, but it's far more common in women. Substantial support for breast cancer awareness and research funding has helped create advances in the diagnosis and 
      treatment of breast cancer. Breast cancer survival rates have increased, and the number of deaths associated with this disease is steadily declining,
      largely due to factors such as earlier detection, a new personalized approach to treatment, and a better understanding of the disease.
